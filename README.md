# Entity Glow

![Powered by OneConfig](https://polyfrost.org/media/branding/badges/badge_1.svg)

This mod is a simple backport of 1.9+'s entity glow/outline feature. The code exists in 1.8.9 but isn't used in the same way. Currently, you need to be in spectator and pressing a specific keybind. However, servers (or at the least Hypixel), sends the necessary information about player entities (at the least), so we can add a check and properly render their glow. Unfortunately the item NBT data is not sent to 1.8.9 clients.

### Modpack?

If you want to use my mods in a Modpack, I ask that the modpack is only available on Modrinth. Feel free to reach out to me if you would like to discuss further.
